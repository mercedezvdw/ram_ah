# Team RAM - Project SmartGrid
## Mercedez van der Wal // Rembrand Ruppert // Yessin Radouane

## Description
*Green energy is the energy of the future, and producing it yourself is the fashion of today. Many houses nowadays have solar panels, wind turbines or other installations to produce energy themselves. Fortunately, these installations often produce more than is needed for own consumption. The surplus could be sold back to the supplier, but the infrastructure (the grid) is often not designed for this. Batteries must be installed to manage peaks in consumption and production.
SmartGrid is a problem that describes a district with these houses and batteries placed on a grid. A solution to this problem is a scenario where all houses are connected to the batteries.*

## Requirements
*To run this program, the user needs to have a working version of python installed and download and unzip the 'ram_ah' folder.
After this, the user needs to install the required packages, listed in 'requirements.txt'.
The user now needs to open the 'ram_ah' directory in the preferred code editor.
Now, the user simply needs to type 'python main.py' into the command line and press enter, and the code will run.*
